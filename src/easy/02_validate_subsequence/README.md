### Prompt
Given two non-empty arrays of integers, write a function that determines whether the second array is a subsequence of the first one.

### Note
A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that aren't necessarily adjacent in the array but that are in the same order as they appear in the array. For instance, the numbers [1, 3, 4] form a subsequence of the array [1, 2, 3, 4], and so do the numbers [2, 4]. A single number in an array and the array itself are both subsequences of the array.

### Input
 array = [5, 1, 22, 25, 6, -1, 8, 10]
 subsequence = [1, 6, -1, 10]

### Output
true

### Optimal Complexities
* O(n) time
* O(1) space
* n is the length of the input array
